# Shabd-Nidhi

**Shabd-Nidhi** is an open Hindi vocabulary resource derived from the **NCERT Hindi textbooks (Classes 1–12)**. It provides a normalized Hindi lexical database to support educational research, language technology, corpus linguistics, and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) initiatives.

---

## Overview

Shabd-Nidhi was created by extracting vocabulary from the Hindi textbooks published by the **National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)**, normalizing OCR and PDF extraction errors, and enriching the resulting vocabulary with corpus statistics and AI-assisted lexical information.

The dataset is intended to serve as a reusable resource for researchers, educators, curriculum designers, lexicographers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) practitioners working with Hindi.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `normalized_word` | Normalized Hindi word                       |
| `frequency`       | Total frequency across the corpus           |
| `earliest_grade`  | First NCERT grade in which the word appears |

---

### `data/shabd_nidhi_lexicon.csv`

Provides AI-generated lexical information for each word.

| Column             | Description                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `word`             | Hindi word                    |

| `pos`              | AI-generated part of speech   |
| `example_sentence` | AI-generated example sentence |

---

### `data/shabd_nidhi_clean.csv`

Maps extracted OCR/PDF word forms to their normalized forms.

| Column            | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `word`            | Original extracted word         |
| `normalized_word` | Corrected/normalized word       |
| `frequency`       | Frequency of the extracted word |

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains Python programs used to generate and process the dataset, including:

* OCR normalization
* Master vocabulary generation
* Lexical metadata generation

---

## Methodology

1. Extract text from NCERT Hindi textbooks (Classes 1–12).
2. Generate a corpus-wide word frequency list.
3. Normalize OCR and PDF extraction errors using a Large Language Model (LLM).
4. Merge duplicate word forms into a single normalized vocabulary.
5. Determine the earliest NCERT grade in which each word first appears.
6. Generate lexical metadata (part of speech and example sentence) using AI.

---

## Applications

Shabd-Nidhi can be used for:

* Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN)
* Educational content development
* Curriculum design
* Hindi Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Vocabulary and corpus analysis
* Readability analysis
* Lexicography
* Educational assessment
* Question generation
* Linguistic research

---

## Limitations

* OCR normalization and lexical metadata are AI-assisted and may contain occasional errors.
* A small number of words may not have an assigned earliest grade because they could not be matched reliably during automated processing.
* The dataset reflects the vocabulary present in NCERT Hindi textbooks and is not intended to represent the complete Hindi lexicon.
